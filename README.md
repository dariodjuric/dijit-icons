# dijit-icons

I haven't been able to find a list of available Dijit button icon images with their respective classes, so I've compiled [this list]http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/dariodjuric/dijit-icons/blob/master/icons.html). Once you've decided the class you want to use, just use it like so:

    <button data-dojo-type="dijit/form/Button" data-dojo-props="iconClass: 'NAME_OF_CLASS'" type="button"></button>
